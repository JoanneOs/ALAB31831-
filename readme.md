Here’s how I set up and run my REST API project from scratch: I first create a folder called rest=api=lab, then open my terminal inside that folder. I run npm init -y to generate a package.json, and then install Express with npm i express. I also create a .gitignore file and add node_modules to keep that folder out of version control. Since I'm not using a real database this week, I’ll store data in a local file data. After that, I install Nodemon as a dev dependency with npm i nodemon --save-dev, which helps restart the server automatically when I make changes. Then I create my folders and files—usually based on the setup I practiced with in the sandbox—and copy over the code structure I need. Before running the project, I also initialize Git with git init, run npm install one more time just in case, and finally start the server using nodemon index.js.
Once everything is set up and the server is running, I test my API on http://localhost:3000. I can view all users by visiting /api/users, or get specific info like posts and comments with endpoints like /api/posts, /api/posts?userId=1, /api/comments?postId=2, and so on. For POST, PATCH, or DELETE requests, I use Postman and send JSON data directly. Everything happens locally, and I can see and test every route smoothly.
